  )[
    - Designed and planned a web path-planning app with slider-based simulation, X/Y field mirroring, and one-click auton code export
    - Building app in React Typescript with Tailwind CSS
    - Planned integration with existing motion library so each planned path is stored in current repository

  )[
  - Open-source library for VEXcode adding odometry, motion control, and an on-brain custom UI framework for real-time PID tuning and autonomous selection
  - Implemented two-tracker IMU odometry, wall resetting, with turn, swing and drive to point, drive to pose, and follow path drive motions
  - Implemented reusable PID class and motion chaining, which values can be individually passed into each drive motion; SD-card save/load for tuning constants and selected autonomous
  - Documented with setup tutorials and Doxygen-style comments; actively maintained
  - Used by 5+ high school robotics teams in competition

    "https://github.com/EthanMik/Wall-Reset-Simulator"
  )[
  - Built a browser-based simulator to validate a wall-reset localization algorithm, using virtual lasers to estimate robot (x, y, Î¸) from distances to field walls
  - Implemented configurable front/left/right/rear lasers with sensor offsets, live visibility toggles, and field switching
  - Deployed on GitHub Pages with documentation

  #project-heading(
    "Scene Maker",
    "Java AWT/SWING",

  )[
    - Built a customizable scene maker; scene is built with background and particles, with velocity, size and amount parameters; snowflake and rain particles are pre-built
    - Snowflakes are procedurally generated, and can be selected to rotate along the x, y and z axes 
    - Placed 1st in the CS3 winter scene competition

    "C# Unity",
    "https://github.com/EthanMik/minigame-roulette"
  )[
    - Developed a Unity game that has a collection of randomized minigames, selected via a roulette wheel
    - Implemented game selection logic and unified scoring across multiple minigame types
    - Designed and programmed multiple interactive minigames with custom physics, movement, event handling and camera scripts
    - Added UI for real-time score display and transitions that contain minigame controls
